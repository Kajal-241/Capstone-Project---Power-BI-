This project is about Power BI. In this project a ShopNest Store data is given. There are 9 different dataset given in it. 
1. Customers_dataset

3. Order_items_dataset
4. Order_payments_dataset
5. Order_reviews_dataset
6. Orders_dataset
7. Products_dataset 
8. Sellers_dataset
9. Product_categories
And there are certain tasks are mentioned below that like - identify top 10 products categories by total sales, number of delayed orders in each category, delayed orders and earlier orders, representing payments methods using pie-chart, top 10 highest-rated products and so on. Create the chart for every task and show it in single dashboard sheet. 
So for this firstly I installed the Power BI in my desktop then there are certain views present like -Data view, model view, report view. After that we load the data in it, then make relationships in model view. Then apply the conditions on the data and make the appropriate charts by using the data.
